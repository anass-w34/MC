To complete Practical 10 using Flutter, which involves creating a ProductBox widget with details like an image, name, price, and description, follow the step-by-step guide below. I'll provide the necessary code and file structure, assuming you are using Android Studio Ladybug.

Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project
Open Android Studio Ladybug.
Select File > New > New Flutter Project.
Choose Flutter Application and set up the project by giving it a name (e.g., product_box_app).
Step 2: Modify pubspec.yaml for Dependencies
Add the required Flutter dependencies:

***********************************************************************************************************
Open the pubspec.yaml file and add image assets (if you want to add a local image for the product).
yaml
Copy code
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/product.png
Ensure you have an image file in the assets/images/ directory.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
pubspec.yaml file 

name: prac_10_1
description: "A new Flutter project."
# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  sdk: ^3.5.3

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

  flutter_lints: ^4.0.0

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # Add assets here
  assets:
    - assets/images/product.png

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package

Step 3: Create the ProductBox Widget
Now, let's create the widget in the lib/main.dart file.

dart
Copy code

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Product Box',
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Product Box'),
        ),
        body: ProductBox(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ProductBox extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
      child: Card(
        child: Padding(
          padding: EdgeInsets.all(15.0),  // Adding padding inside the card for spacing
          child: Row(
            children: <Widget>[
              // Adjusting the image container to scale the image
              Container(
                width: 150,  // Setting fixed width for better sizing
                height: 150, // Setting fixed height for better sizing
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
                ),
                child: ClipRRect(
                  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),
                  child: Image.asset(
                    'assets/images/product.png',
                    fit: BoxFit.cover,  // Ensure the image fits inside the container
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              SizedBox(width: 20.0),  // Adding more space between the image and text
              Expanded(
                child: Column(
                  crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                  children: <Widget>[
                    Text(
                      'Product Name',
                      style: TextStyle(
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                        fontSize: 24,
                        color: Colors.green,
                      ),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: 10),  // Adding space between the name and description
                    Text(
                      'This is a description of the product.',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16),
                    ),
                    SizedBox(height: 10),  // Adding space between description and price
                    Text(
                      '\$49.99',
                      style: TextStyle(
                        fontSize: 20,
                        color: Colors.orange,
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                      ),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}


*********************************************************************************************************
Step 4: Directory and File Structure
After completing the steps, your project structure will look like this:

bash
Copy code
product_box_app/
│
├── android/
├── ios/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart                # Main file with the ProductBox widget
│
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── product.png           # Product image
├── pubspec.yaml                  # Flutter dependencies
Explanation of the Code
Container: Used for adding padding around the widget.
Row: Aligns the product image and product details horizontally.
Column: Arranges the product name, description, and price vertically.
Expanded: Used inside the Row to allow the Column to take up the available space.
Card: Adds a card-like design around the product details.
Text: Displays the product name, description, and price.
Image: Displays the product image using Image.asset().


Step 5: Run the App
Run the app using the Play button in Android Studio or run it using the terminal with the following command:
bash
Copy code
flutter run
This will display the ProductBox as per the layout provided in your requirement.

***************************************************************************************************************************

where is this directory assets/images/ ???????????????????????

The assets/images/ directory is where you store images or other static files that your Flutter app needs to access.

Here’s how you can create the assets/images/ directory:

Steps to Create assets/images/ Directory:
Navigate to the project folder:

Open your Flutter project folder in Android Studio Ladybug or in your system's file explorer.
Create the folders:

Inside your project folder, find the assets directory. If the assets folder doesn’t already exist, create a new folder called assets.
Inside the assets folder, create another folder named images.
Your directory structure should now look like this:

Copy code
product_box_app/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
Add your image:

Place your image file (e.g., product.png) inside the assets/images/ folder. For example:
Copy code
product_box_app/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── product.png
Reference the image in pubspec.yaml:

Open your pubspec.yaml file in Android Studio, and make sure you declare the asset path like this:
yaml
Copy code
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/product.png
Run flutter pub get:

After saving the pubspec.yaml file, run flutter pub get in the terminal (or use the Android Studio interface) to ensure the assets are included in your project.
Use the image in your Flutter code:

As in the code provided earlier, use Image.asset('assets/images/product.png') to load the image into your app.
Final Structure
After following these steps, your project’s structure should look like this:

css
Copy code
product_box_app/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       └── product.png
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart
├── pubspec.yaml
